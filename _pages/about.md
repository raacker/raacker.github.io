Hello there! Thanks for dropping by. 

This blog is one of my hobby where I jot down some ideas or log any helpful resources from my experiences. 

I've been working as a Software Engineer for more than 4 years so far. The major experiences are focused on C++, Performance Optimization, 3D Mesh Processing and ImGui & 3D Rendering. You can visit [Polyga](https://www.polyga.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haven-kim/) to find more :) 

Besides, I've been working on some iPhone & Flutter apps to give a breath to my "helpful" ideas. Looking forward to share the app links very soon!

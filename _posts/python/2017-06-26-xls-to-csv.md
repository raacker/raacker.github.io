When you are dealing with opendata or any sort of dataset, you should reprocess your dataset including cleansing. It can be separating or merging columns or deleting some miss-placed data. CSV and TSV are the most well-known formats but what if you have to deal with xls and xlsx?

For sake of ease formatting, let's convert them into csv (with a package :))

* The dev environment is Ubuntu.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install gnumeric
```

First of all, install gnumeric first. It will provide us a fancy tool, ssconvert.
ssconvert or SpreadSheetconvert, is a converting tool for spreadsheet data.

Next,

```bash
$ ssconvert something.xlsx something.csv
```

Just a piece of cake.


If you want to know what types of format supported, try this. Or just checkout the [manual page](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnumeric/stable/sect-files-ssconvert.html.en).

```bash
$ ssconvert --list-importers
$ ssconvert --list-exporters
```

Great job. But... what if your files crashed because of bad unicodes..

Try this.

```bash
# ex) $ iconv -f "from this encode" -t "to this encode" filename.csv > filename.csv

$ iconv -f euc-kr -t utf-8 2015_broken_encode_set.csv > 2015_dataset.csv
```

Happy Hacking!

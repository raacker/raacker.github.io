excerpt: "Teach me in one sentence, Design Pattern series - Introduction"
---

Frankly, I cannot make one sentence-d design pattern course. Obviously design pattern is a very abstract but has essential aspect of software engineering problems we have been struggling every day. It already sounds very hard to demonstrate them in a sentence ðŸ˜…

But let me give a shot. 

I am certain that I wasn't quite ready to study and fully understand Design Pattern until now. After making tons of mistakes on product designs, architectural problems and experience of solving those I was able to find myself feeling comfortable dealing with them and in fact, I already had lots of code samples on my hand and head.

Thanks to the [Vancouver KDD group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/VancouverKDD/) and its passionate members, we were able to successfully finish the [GoF design pattern study group](https://github.com/Vancouver-KDD/book-study-gof-design-pattern). Following series of posts are based on my study note + extra editing and materials.

I personally think the best way of studying design pattern or refactoring is 

1. Understand how it looks in code briefly.
    > It will give you a high level picture of ~~how messy~~ relationships in between classes or logics.

2. Understand the *Intent*. 
    > I bet you would agree that the lots of design patterns look similar or the same in the code. But all of them have different intention and idea to solve a specific problem. Hence, understanding **why** is the most important aspect I would say.

3. Write a lot of sample codes!
    > Ideas are abstract. Unless they are instantiated they won't be a good tool for you. Try writing a practical pattern code.

4. Try summarizing the content and explain it to your friend.
    > Best way of learning? it is teaching someone else.

<br/>
And about the sample codes I provide. I find some of online samples are written only for diagram purpose, with absence of practical usage. I hate them because I literally forgot most of those code examples since they remain too abstract. 

I will try hard to cover the practical usage (or closer aspect) as much as possible and will mention on each example if they don't align perfectly to the pattern's specification.

Hope my posts to be a Design Pattern Haven and give you a spoon of sweets on understanding design patterns.
